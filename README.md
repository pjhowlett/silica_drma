## Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of silica exposure and silicosis risk 

# Overview
Welcome to the Dose-Response Meta-Analysis project! This R project aims to analyze the relationship between exposure levels and specific outcomes in "mine" and non-mine populations. The project includes the following key components:

# Data Loading:
Please load data from the three data files in this folder: risk_complete.xlsx, risk_drma_2.xlsx and chen2.csv
Data is loaded and prepared in the "Load data" section of the rcs_silicosis_fin script.
Purpose: Load and explore the dataset to gain insights into the available information.

# Cumulative risks comparisons:
Cumulative risks both parametric and non-parametric are compared in the "Comparison of life table cumulative risks" and "Comparison of fitted cumulative risks" headings in the rcs_silicosis_fin script

# Meta-Analysis:
A dose-response meta-analysis of the risk of silicosis at increasing silica exposures is performed in the "Dose response meta-analysis", "Miner DRMA" and "Non-Miner DRMA" sections. 
Sensitivity analyses are performed in the "Sensitivity Analysis" section. 

# Impact Analysis: 
The absolute risk reduction is calculated in the "Impact Analysis" section.

Run the scripts in the specified order to reproduce the analysis.
Explore the results and visualizations generated by the scripts.
Feel free to reach out for any questions or feedback. Happy analyzing!
